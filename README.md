## 🚀 About Me

I'm a young and passionate Python developer who loves building applications that don't just work — they **look amazing** too!  
I focus on making apps with creative and clean user interfaces using a dark blue theme to give that professional, techy vibe.

Despite my age, I’m constantly learning, experimenting, and pushing the limits of what I can build with Python.
